# TR-404 Drum sequencer

I have had an interest in electronic music, DJing, and it's production methods for a number of years. 
Pieces of hardware equipment such as the Roland Tr-808 Or Korg Volca Beats have been widely used to synthesise drum sequences to be used for a wide range of musical genres.

An example of such hardware is included: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sxZyjpd2KoM

I have decided to create a simple implementation of a drum machine; while the base logic of a sequencer is realatively simple, it will give me the opportunity to 
add a large amount of complexity and features to it.

Features:

- Currently Includes 5 Multi-track, 16 beat/4 bar instrument rows
- Timing is synced up to provide repeating playback, allowing the user to change beat patterns in real time 
- playback functionality: play and stop logic
- time keeping mechanics present in the form of time elapsed and beat position
- beats per minute (BPM) counter, able to change playback speed in real time
